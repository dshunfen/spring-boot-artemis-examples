# Spring Boot Artemis Examples

This is a project hosting Artemis examples using Spring tooling. These are very simple examples loosely based on the provided examples in the Artemis project, in the [examples folder](https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis/tree/master/examples).

Instead of using the manual (e.g. plumbing) setup in the examples, the goal of this project is to provided simple and (String) autoconfigured solutions to these examples using Spring.

## Setup

This can be done with STS, command line, or other IDE:

### STS
One simple needs to import this project into their local IDE workspace. That is, ideally in Spring Tool Suite (STS)
